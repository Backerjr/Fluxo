  **Design Movement**: "Cyber-Zen Brutalism"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Radical Transparency**: Data is the hero; UI is the frame. No decorative fluff.
  2. **Monochromatic Mastery**: Strict grayscale palette with a single, piercing accent color (e.g., neon lime or electric violet) used only for critical status.
  3. **Information Density**: High-density layouts that feel organized, not cluttered. Think financial terminals met Swiss design.
  4. **Instant Feedback**: Every interaction has an immediate, micro-haptic visual response.

  **Color Philosophy**: "The Void & The Signal". Deepest blacks (#050505) for the background to minimize eye strain and make data pop. White text for maximum contrast. The accent color represents "intelligence" or "action".

  **Layout Paradigm**: "The Data Loom". A persistent, multi-pane layout where the user can see the list, details, and AI reasoning simultaneously. No page loads; everything is a state change within the loom.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **The Monospace Hybrid**: Use a high-quality monospace font (like JetBrains Mono or Geist Mono) for all data points, paired with a grotesque sans-serif for headers.
  2. **Grid Lines**: Subtle, 1px grid lines that define the structure, reminiscent of graph paper or blueprints.
  3. **Glitch/Scanline Effects**: Very subtle, occasional animations on data updates to suggest a live feed.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Keyboard First". The entire interface should be navigable via keyboard shortcuts (Command+K, J/K for navigation). Mouse interaction is secondary.

  **Animation**: "Snap & Flow". Instant state changes for data (snap), but smooth, fluid transitions for panels and overlays (flow).

  **Typography System**:
  - Headers: Inter (Bold, Tight Tracking)
  - Body/Data: Geist Mono (Regular, tabular nums)
  - Labels: Inter (Uppercase, widely tracked)

  **Design Movement**: "Ethereal Glassmorphism"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Light & Depth**: The interface feels like layers of frosted glass floating in a void.
  2. **Softness & Approachability**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and blurred backgrounds to make complex data feel friendly.
  3. **Fluidity**: Elements flow into each other; no hard borders.
  4. **Ambient Intelligence**: AI insights appear as glowing, soft-edged auras or highlights.

  **Color Philosophy**: "Aurora Borealis". A dark background with subtle, shifting gradients of deep purple, teal, and blue in the background (blurred heavily). Foreground elements are semi-transparent white/grey.

  **Layout Paradigm**: "The Floating Workspace". Panels and cards float above the background. The active element lifts up and becomes more opaque.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Frosted Glass Cards**: All containers use `backdrop-filter: blur()`.
  2. **Glowing Borders**: Active elements have a soft, colored glow instead of a hard border.
  3. **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: A central, intelligent action button that morphs based on context.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Touch & Glide". Interactions feel like moving physical objects on a smooth surface. Drag-and-drop is a primary interaction model.

  **Animation**: "Drift & Dissolve". Elements drift into place; changes dissolve softly. Slow, calming motion.

  **Typography System**:
  - Headers: SF Pro Display (Medium)
  - Body: SF Pro Text (Regular)
  - Accents: A serif font (like Playfair Display) for AI insights to make them feel "authored".

  **Design Movement**: "International Typographic Style (Swiss Style) Redux"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid is God**: Absolute adherence to a strict modular grid.
  2. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetrical layouts to create visual interest and hierarchy.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography is the primary visual element.
  4. **Objective Photography/Iconography**: Clean, factual imagery.

  **Color Philosophy**: "Print on Screen". Stark white or very light grey background (#F5F5F5). Black text. Primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow) used in their purest forms for categorization.

  **Layout Paradigm**: "The Magazine Spread". The dashboard looks like a well-laid-out editorial spread. Data is grouped into clear, bold blocks.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Massive Headers**: Section titles are huge and bold.
  2. **Thick Rules**: Heavy black lines to separate sections.
  3. **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles and squares for status indicators.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Click & Snap". Interactions are crisp and decisive. Buttons have hard edges and clear hover states.

  **Animation**: "Slide & Reveal". Panels slide in from the sides; content reveals itself from behind masks.

  **Typography System**:
  - Primary: Helvetica Now (or similar neo-grotesque)
  - Weights: Ranging from Hairline to Black.
  - Hierarchy: Established strictly through size and weight.
